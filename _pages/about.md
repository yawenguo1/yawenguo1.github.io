Hi, I’m **Yawen Guo**, a PhD student in the Department of Informatics at UC Irvine.  
My work sits at the intersection of **AI** and **clinical informatics**, with a focus on how NLP and LLMs can improve patient–provider communication and clinical workflows.

### research focus
- **Secure messaging (patient–provider):** large-scale reviews; content & UX analyses; LLM-assisted triage/drafting and safety.
- **Ambient AI scribes / documentation:** effects on efficiency, note quality, and equity.
- **Data drift & monitoring:** pipelines for structured + text data (BioBERT embeddings; KL/JS/KS; PCA-based drift).

### collaborations
- **UCI Health** (clinical documentation & messaging)
- **Mayo Clinic** (LLM-assisted social determinants of health(SDoH) ontology development)
- **Keck Medicine of USC** (drift monitoring & predictive modeling)

### selected recognition
- **AMIA Student Paper Competition – 2nd Place (2022)**
- **AMIA Best Student Paper – Finalist (2024)**

### teaching
- **INF 171 – Health Informatics**: Teaching Assistant (2021)  
- **INF 171 – Health Informatics**: Guest Lecture — *Clinical AI applications* (2024)

I build practical, reproducible tooling for clinicians and data teams and enjoy collaborative, open science.
