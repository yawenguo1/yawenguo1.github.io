Hi, I’m **Yawen Guo**, a PhD student in the Department of Informatics at UC Irvine.  
My work sits at the intersection of **AI** and **clinical informatics**, with a focus on how NLP and LLMs can improve patient–provider communication and clinical workflows.

### research focus

- **Ambient AI for clinical scribes and documentation** — evaluation of ambient note–generation tools, customization across specialties, and impact on efficiency, equity, and education.  
- **Patient–provider communication via patient portals** — large-scale analyses of secure messaging, computational methods, and AI-assisted triage/drafting tools.  
- **Social media–based population health analytics** — large-scale text mining (Twitter, YouTube) for public attitudes toward health policies and pandemic responses.  
- **Mining social determinants of health (SDOH)** — developing a cardiovascular disease–specific SDOH ontology from large-scale clinical notes, integrating SDOH with predictive modeling of outcomes.  

### collaborations

- **UCI Health**  
  - Clinical AI for documentation (Epic Signal, ambient scribes)  
  - AI-assisted secure messaging in patient portals  
  - AI chatbot pilots to streamline resident workflows  

- **Mayo Clinic**  
  - LLM-assisted SDOH ontology development (cardiovascular focus)  
  - Predictive modeling for cardiovascular risk incorporating SDOH  

- **Keck Medicine of USC**  
  - Drift monitoring pipelines for structured and unstructured clinical data (BioBERT embeddings; KL/JS/KS; PCA-based drift)  
  - Predictive modeling for transfer center case prioritization, length of stay, readmission, and mortality  


### selected recognition
- **AMIA Student Paper Competition – 2nd Place (2022)**
- **AMIA Best Student Paper – Finalist (2024)**

### teaching
- **INF 171 – Health Informatics**: Teaching Assistant (2021)  
- **INF 171 – Health Informatics**: Guest Lecture — *Clinical AI applications* (2024, 2025)

I build practical, reproducible tooling for clinicians and data teams and enjoy collaborative, open science.
